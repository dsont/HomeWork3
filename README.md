This code works as a song library builder allowing users to create and name playlists, adds songs to said playlist, add songs to an overall library, as well as 
add the playlists they created to the library. The users are asked to input song titles, genres, and artists. They are also asked to name the new playlists they
choose to create and provide a brief description that will be later displayed when the overall library is called to print at the end of the program. There is a .txt
file provided of songs along with their artist and genre. This program is executed by running the Spotify.java class. This is where the overall library will be printed and the songs/playlists the users add as well. 

Example input for a single song:
Song: Can I Call You Tonigh?
Artist: DAYGLOW
Genre: Indie

Example output for a single song:
Title: Can I Call You Tonight?
Artist: DAYGLOW
Genre: Indie

Example input for a playlist:
What would you like name your playlist?
